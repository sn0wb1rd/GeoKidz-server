## **Abstract**
GeoKidz is a social outdoor game where kids can create and search for treasures by learning how to find their way with a digital map.
When the treasure is found you can gain rewards and optionally find a new hideout nearby.

## **Description**
GeoKidz is the last project of our bootcamp at Ironhack.

After three months of intense work, we had one week and a half to realized a full-stack application, fully responsive, in React. As a geodata specialist, Cindy suggested using geolocalisation for our project. GeoKidz was born !

We created a game for kids that allows us to use several technologies, including React, MongoDB, an API with NodeJs, and ExpressJs. With GeoKids, the user can visualize the treasures around him, which are painted stones, and collect them in order to earn points. He can also create his own painted stone, and place it on our map. Developing this game and working together has been a great and learningfull experience and we hope that you will feel all the pleasure we had working on it !
